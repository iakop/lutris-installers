# lutris-installers
A collection of my own custom game installers for local installation on lutris.
Requires at least lutris-0.5.3 to run.

List of installers and dependencies:
### TIS-100 (Win GOG installer, played through wine)
	- Dependencies:	
		- `wine`
		- `wine-mono`
		- `lib32-libpulse`
		- `innoextract`
	- Notes:
		- *The in-game manual does not launch in a PDF viewer. It resides within the installed folder in the prefix, however. This shouldn't break more than the experience of launching the manual from the game.*
		- *The optimal way to play is by printing the manual anyway.*
### Stardew Valley (Win GOG installer, played through wine)
	- Dependencies:
		- `wine`
		- `wine-mono`
		- `winetricks`
		- `lib32-libpulse`
		- `lib32-alsa-plugins`
		- `lib32-openal`
		- `lib32-mpg123`
		- `innoextract`
	- Notes:
		- *N/A*
